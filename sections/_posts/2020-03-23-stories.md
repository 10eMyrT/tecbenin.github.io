## Welcome to {{page.title}} !

As all the other sections of Titigweti English Club, Stories And Jokes aims at providing the best environment to acquire English, not just as a language, but as a skill. To this end, we have a lot of activities through which we learn and practice English. The main ones are: stories telling, jokes performances (playing comedy), poems and slams saying. We also deal with activities such as: dictation, interpretation, lexicon, etc. And many others of the kind. We believe that with the contribution of each member of that awesome family that we are, everybody can reach their individual goals, and all together, we can get to our common destination.
