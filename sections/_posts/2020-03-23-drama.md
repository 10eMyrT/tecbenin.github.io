excerpt: In this section, we deal with sketches that we have to create and play. Then, by so doing, not only do we practice the English language, but we also get many words for all contexts of life (that we create to ourselves and live in, on stage, of course) and we gain the skills to write plays.

## Welcome to {{page.title}} !

Drama section is one of the six sections of Titigweti English Club. In that section, we are all creative, meaning that after looking at everything happening in our society, we get inspired and bring those realities on the stage. Most of the time, members of drama section play on life realities and make the audience draw lessons from their performances. Indeed, in drama section, we work on how to catch mood, emotion, and improvisation. so, to be brief and short, as our objective is to help members improve their levels as far as Shakespeare’s language speaking is concerned, we try our best to write scripts and let them know what to say and how to behave before an audience.

Some of our activities:

* Warming-up
* Sharing of knowledge
* Exercises on listening and reading
* Debate
* Members’ speeches
* Exercises on moods
* Grammar lessons
* Games
* Drama performances
