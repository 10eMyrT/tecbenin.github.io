            <div class="lead col-lg-10 text-justify mx-auto">
                The history of Titigweti English Club mounts the early 1990s, though we consider the club was officially created 1996 by students of the Department of English in 1996. The name Titigweti was taken from the tale ‘’Titigweti and the elephant’’ in the book EFSA, standing for English For French Speaking Africa by the late Boniface Zodeogan. The original aim of the English club of the University of Abomey-Calavi was to gather all students of the Department as well as English lovers and be a melting pot where each and all of them can practice and brush up their knowledge of Shakespeare’s Language. The founders had then initiated various sections which were meant to be the basement for the club. As life goes on, things evolved and many changes occurred in the overall structure of the club. We currently have six fantastic sections in Titigweti English Club namely: Debate and Discussion Section, Drama Section, Listening Section, News Section, Reading Section, and Stories and Jokes Section. Each section holds its different activities twice a week in different venues on the campus. The club today is the oldest and biggest English club in Benin with hundreds of current and former members who are known all over the country and overseas. Titigweti English Club is led by an Executive Board of nine elected members and by an Animation Board with appointed Heads and vice-heads of sections.
